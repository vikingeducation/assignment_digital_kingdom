# Digital Kingdom - practice with Express.js & Node.js

Here is the Kingdom that shows hierarchy of Kingdoms, Kings, Queens, Castles, Lieges, Vassals. The user can add a new one and jump in between them. The http path is reflecting this hierarchical layering. All is build using Express.js. I am parsing json files based in data folder, reading them into different tables showing structure of the Kingdom or updating them when user adds new Castle in  Kingdom.

Play responsibly! :)
